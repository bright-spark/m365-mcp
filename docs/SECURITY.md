# Security Considerations

This document outlines important security considerations for deploying and using the Microsoft 365 MCP Server.

## Authentication Security

### OAuth 2.0 with PKCE

The server uses OAuth 2.0 with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange), which is the recommended approach for securing OAuth flows in public clients where a client secret cannot be securely stored. This method:

- Prevents authorization code interception attacks
- Eliminates the need for client secrets in browser-based applications
- Provides a secure way to obtain and refresh tokens

### Token Storage

In the current implementation, tokens are stored in memory, which means:

- Tokens are lost if the server restarts
- No persistent storage means less risk of token leakage
- Only suitable for development or personal use

For production environments, consider implementing:

- Encrypted database storage for tokens
- Token rotation mechanisms
- Secure cookie storage with proper security flags

## Session Security

The server uses `express-session` for managing user sessions. Consider these improvements for production:

- Use a production-ready session store like Redis or MongoDB
- Enable secure cookies with proper flags (`secure`, `httpOnly`, `sameSite`)
- Implement session expiration and rotation
- Set appropriate CORS policies

Example production session configuration:

```javascript
app.use(session({
  secret: process.env.SESSION_SECRET,
  resave: false,
  saveUninitialized: false,
  cookie: { 
    secure: true, // requires HTTPS
    httpOnly: true,
    sameSite: 'strict',
    maxAge: 3600000 // 1 hour
  },
  store: new RedisStore({ /* config */ }) // requires redis package
}));
```

## Transport Security

For production deployments:

- **Always use HTTPS** - Never deploy the server without TLS/SSL
- Set up proper SSL certificate (Let's Encrypt is a free option)
- Implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
- Consider using a reverse proxy like Nginx for additional security layers

## Permission Considerations

The Microsoft Graph API permissions requested by this application are broad. Consider:

- Requesting only the permissions you need
- Using incremental consent to ask for permissions as needed
- Explaining to users why each permission is required

## Data Security

- The server does not store email content or attachments locally
- Consider implementing data sanitization for user inputs
- Be aware of data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) if deploying publicly

## Deployment Recommendations

### For Personal Use

The current implementation is suitable for personal use or development when:
- Running on localhost
- Used by a single user
- Not exposed to the public internet

### For Production

If deploying for production or multi-user scenarios:

1. Implement a secure token storage solution
2. Add user authentication and authorization
3. Set up HTTPS with proper certificates
4. Use environment-specific configurations
5. Add rate limiting and monitoring
6. Consider containerization (Docker) for deployment
7. Implement proper logging and auditing
8. Set up security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)

## Regular Security Maintenance

- Keep dependencies updated with `npm audit` and regular updates
- Follow Microsoft Graph API security recommendations
- Monitor for suspicious activities
- Implement token revocation mechanisms

## Revoking Access

Users can revoke access to the application at any time by:

1. Visiting [Microsoft Account Permissions](https://account.live.com/consent/Manage)
2. Finding the app in the list
3. Selecting "Remove these permissions"
